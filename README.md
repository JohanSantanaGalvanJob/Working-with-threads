# Working-with-threads
Java project made for my programming subject which consists of  working and implementing threads using an example of preparation of a typical canarian dish.

## Java classes Explained

The primary objective of this project is to develop skills in creating threads in order to perform it on future projects. 

This is the activity diagram:

## Some examples of the execution

As you may have see, the order of the threads varies a bit on every execution of the program and that is because this program is created to execute the threads that are independent and then execute the threads that are need other threads.
To explain this better we need to look at the activity diagram. In this diagram you can see that if you want to execute the thread 2, the thread 1 must be already executed. 
This also applies with the thread 4 that needs both thread 2 and 3 to execute
